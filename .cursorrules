# UI Component Guidelines

## shadcn/ui Components Only

- **ALWAYS use shadcn/ui components** for all UI elements. Never create custom UI components from scratch or use other UI libraries.
- Import shadcn components from `@/components/ui` (e.g., `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"`).
- If a shadcn component doesn't exist for a needed UI element, first check the shadcn component library and install it using `npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]`.
- Only create custom components that compose shadcn components together, not replacements for shadcn components.
- Use shadcn's styling system (Tailwind CSS with CSS variables) for all styling.
- Icons should come from the configured icon library (lucide-react) as specified in components.json.

## Component Structure

- All UI components should be built using shadcn/ui primitives.
- Custom business logic components can wrap shadcn components but should not replace them.
- Maintain consistency with shadcn's design system and theming approach.
